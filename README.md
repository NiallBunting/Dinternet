# Distributed internet (dinternet)

This idea is to have a distributed internet where you own your own data.

This is just a work in progress - proof of concept and will be glued together to see if the concept works.

Comprising of many parts:
* p2p internet
* data hosted throughout the network
* data controlled by the user
* each user is a node
* s3 backing

# This will be written in two parts for now
* Node (Handles the p2p nature) and ensuring the files exist.
* Browser how you browse the dinternet.
